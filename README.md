The fonts are available in the "Fonts" folder, and are in .ttf &amp; .otf format

<br>

I was looking for the fonts of the cipher of "The Dancing Man" by Sherlock Holmes, <BR>and looking online I found some examples, such as the one on this page: 
<br>
http://gutenberg.osdn.jp/font/en.html

<br>

Testing the fonts, however, i immediately noticed that something was wrong, <br>in fact the cipher is not respected at all ...
<br>
so I wonder what the fuck did they do it for?
<br>
So I look for others, and I find them, but as usual on the web it's all a clone of a clone ...
<br>
Fuck!
<br>
Anyway, I needed the same, and I needed the right one ...
<br>
So what?
<br>
And so, as usual, if you want a decent job you have to do it yourself ...
<br>
And here we are ...
<br>
I take advantage of it to share with all those like me who loved the story,<BR> and want to use the fonts for their own purposes.
